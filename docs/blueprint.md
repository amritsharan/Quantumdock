# **App Name**: QuantumDock

## Core Features:

- Molecule Input: Allow users to input molecular structures using SMILES strings or PDB files.
- Target Selection: Enable users to select a biological target (protein) from a database or upload a custom protein structure.
- Classical Molecular Docking (RDKit & AutoDock): Implement classical molecular docking using RDKit for molecule preparation and AutoDock for performing docking simulations.
- Quantum Refinement with VQE/QAOA: Refine the poses generated from classical docking by calculating binding energies using VQE or QAOA.  The system will use these tools when refinement could improve overall score.
- Binding Affinity Prediction: Predict binding affinities based on quantum-refined energies.
- Visualization: Provide interactive 3D visualization of the docked complexes.
- Result Export: Allow users to export docking results in standard formats.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#2E5266) to evoke a sense of scientific rigor and technological advancement.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F7), a slightly desaturated hue of the primary color, creating a clean, unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: Teal (#4DB6AC), an analogous color that offers a fresh and modern contrast to the deep blue.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look.
- Use a set of consistent, minimalist icons related to chemical structures, quantum computing, and data visualization.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations when loading or processing molecular data to provide visual feedback.
- A clean, grid-based layout that emphasizes clear data presentation and intuitive user workflows.
