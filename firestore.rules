/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for QuantumDock application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all data. Each user can only
 * access their own data, and no data is shared between users unless explicitly defined
 * through a shared access pattern (not present in this version).
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, which enforces a clear ownership boundary.
 * - /users/{userId}: User profile data.
 * - /users/{userId}/molecules/{moleculeId}: Molecules owned by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/proteinTargets/{proteinTargetId}: Protein targets owned by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/dockingSimulations/{dockingSimulationId}: Docking simulations owned by the user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - No user listing is allowed.
 * - All data is private to the owner (authenticated user).
 * - No shared access or roles are implemented in this initial version.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The data structure itself denormalizes the user ID into the path, eliminating the need
 * for get() calls or document-level ownership fields. The path /users/{userId}/...
 * inherently implies ownership by the user with the ID {userId}.
